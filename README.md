# customizableNet


This python code is for a neural network that is customizable to the user's liking. The user can choose the size and structure of the neural net (number of layers and number of 
neurons per layer) depending on how demanding the training data is.

The optimizer used for gradient descent is capable of learning any linear mathematical function perfectly, even if the function has a shift (b in y = mx + b) and predicting output
of trained function for unseen data.

It is uncapable of learning decreasing functions since data normalization isn't included.
